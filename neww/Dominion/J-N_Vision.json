Tenant's Operating Costs Payment\n\nTenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, for each year or fractional year during the Term, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the amount by which Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined) exceed Base Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined). Tenant's payment is hereinafter referred to as the \"Operating Costs Payment\" and shall be due in accordance with the following:\n\n### A.\n\nAt the beginning of each calendar year during the Term and any renewal term (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with an estimate (\"Estimate\") of the Operating Costs Payment for the forthcoming year. On the first day of each calendar month during such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's estimated Operating Costs Payment as shown on the Estimate. If for any reason Landlord has not provided Tenant with the Estimate at the beginning of any year during the Term, then Tenant shall continue to pay Tenant's Operating Costs Payment payable for the previous year, and promptly after receipt of Landlord's Estimate, Tenant shall pay to Landlord any deficiency between the amounts actually paid for such year and the amount due in accordance with Landlord's Estimate for such year. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord shall have the right from time to time during any year to adjust such Estimate.\n\n### B.\n\nAt the beginning of the second calendar year and all subsequent calendar years during the Term (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement of the actual Operating Costs Payment for the preceding year. If Tenant's actual Operating Costs Payment for such preceding year, as shown on Landlord's statement, exceeds the aggregate of the monthly installments of Tenant's Operating Costs Payments paid during the preceding year, within thirty (30) days after Landlord's delivery of such statement, Tenant shall make a lump sum payment to Landlord in the amount of such excess. If Tenant's actual Operating Costs Payment as shown on Landlord's statement is less than the aggregate of the monthly installments actually paid by Tenant during such preceding year, then Landlord shall apply such amount to the next accruing installment(s) of Additional Rent due from Tenant under this Section 9.01 until fully credited to Tenant.\n\n### C.\n\nA pro rata adjustment shall be made to Tenant's Operating Costs Payment for the years in which the term of the Lease begins and ends, as necessary.\n\n## Section 9.02. Operating Costs\n\nFor purposes of this Lease, the term \"Operating Costs\" shall mean any and all expenses, costs and disbursements of every kind which Landlord pays, incurs or becomes obligated to pay in connection with the operation, management, repair and maintenance of all portions of the Project. All Operating Costs shall be determined according to generally accepted accounting principles which shall be consistently applied.

Tenant's Operating Costs Payment\n\nTenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, for each year or fractional year during the Term, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the amount by which Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined) exceed Base Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined). Tenant's payment is hereinafter referred to as the \"Operating Costs Payment\" and shall be due in accordance with the following:\n\n# A.\n\nAt the beginning of each calendar year during the Term and any renewal term (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with an estimate (\"Estimate\") of the Operating Costs Payment for the forthcoming year. On the first day of each calendar month during such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's estimated Operating Costs Payment as shown on the Estimate. If for any reason Landlord has not provided Tenant with the Estimate at the beginning of any year during the Term, then Tenant shall continue to pay Tenant's Operating Costs Payment payable for the previous year, and promptly after receipt of Landlord's Estimate, Tenant shall pay to Landlord any deficiency between the amounts actually paid for such year and the amount due in accordance with Landlord's Estimate for such year. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord shall have the right from time to time during any year to adjust such Estimate.\n\n# B.\n\nAt the beginning of the second calendar year and all subsequent calendar years during the Term (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement of the actual Operating Costs Payment for the preceding year.

If Tenant's actual Operating Costs Payment as shown on Landlord's statement is less than the aggregate of the monthly installments actually paid by Tenant during such preceding year, then Landlord shall apply such amount to the next accruing installment(s) of Additional Rent due from Tenant under this Section 9.01 until fully credited to Tenant.\n\n# C.\n\nA pro rata adjustment shall be made to Tenant's Operating Costs Payment for the years in which the term of the Lease begins and ends, as necessary.\n\n# Section 9.02. Operating Costs\n\nFor purposes of this Lease, the term \"Operating Costs\u201d shall mean any and all expenses, costs and disbursements of every kind which Landlord pays, incurs or becomes obligated to pay in connection with the operation, management, repair and maintenance of all portions of the Project.
