Guarantor guarantees that all sums stated in the Lease to be payable by Assignee shall be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the Lease and that Assignee shall perform and observe all of its obligations under the Lease. If any such sum or obligation is not timely paid, performed or observed for any reason, Guarantor shall, promptly after notice thereof and prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period granted to Assignee under the Lease, pay or perform the same in full regardless of (a) any defense or right of set off or counterclaim which Assignee or Guarantor may have or assert against Landlord, (b) whether Landlord shall have taken any steps to enforce any rights against Assignee or any other person, (c) termination of the Lease as a result of Assignee\u2019s default or any other reason (including Bankruptcy), or (d) any other condition or contingency. Guarantor shall also pay all expenses of collecting any such sum or otherwise enforcing this Guaranty, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. This Guaranty is a guaranty of full performance and payment and not merely collection.\n\n2. This Guaranty is continuing and unconditional. Except to the extent the obligations of Guarantor hereunder are performed in full, there is no circumstance under which Guarantor shall be discharged from any of its obligations under, or have any defenses to enforcement of, this Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor\u2019s obligations hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by reason of the happening from time to time of any of the following, whether or not Guarantor has received notice thereof or consented thereto: (a) any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the Lease or this Guaranty, or any part thereof, or any term hereof or thereof; (b) any defense or set-off or counterclaim of Assignee or Guarantor; (c) Landlord\u2019s waiver of performance by Assignee, Guarantor or any other party of any covenant or condition contained in the Lease or this Guaranty; (d) any amendment, extension, renewal or other modification of the Lease or this Guaranty; (e) any sale or other transfer by Landlord of all or any part of its interest in the Lease or this Guaranty; (f) any failure of Landlord to give notice to Guarantor of any default by Assignee or any other party under the Lease or this Guaranty; (g) any release of Assignee or Guarantor or any other party from any obligations under the Lease or this Guaranty; (h) any change in the ownership of Assignee or Guarantor; (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting Assignee or Guarantor or any of their respective assets; or (j) any other act or omission of Landlord or any other party.\n\n3. Guarantor waives presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, and notice of non-payment, non-performance or non-observance, notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by Assignee. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, Guarantor waives any right Guarantor may now or hereafter have against Assignee with respect to this Guaranty.",
