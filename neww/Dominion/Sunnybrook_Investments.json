In all cases of default, and/or in the event of a reentry or retaking by Landlord, Tenant shall nevertheless remain liable and answerable for the full Rent to the date of default, retaking or reentry and for all Rent through the balance of the Lease Term and Tenant shall forfeit all unpaid Landlord concessions, allowances for Tenant Work and all other inducements or concessions which may be referenced under the Lease or Work Agreement. Tenant shall also be and remain answerable in damages for (i) any deficiency or loss of Rent, (ii) all related costs and expenses which Landlord may thereby reasonably sustain in re-letting the Premises to a new tenant including, without limitation, brokerage commissions, costs of improving or constructing the Premises, rental abatement, architectural fees, engineering fees and legal fees (collectively the \u201cRe-letting Costs\u201d), (iii) all reasonable costs and expenses relating to Landlord's efforts to enforce the terms of the Lease and collect amounts due hereunder, and (iv) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Landlord (whether incurred prior to or after Tenant\u2019s occupancy of the Premises) in connection with Tenant\u2019s initial lease (or renewals thereof) or occupancy in the Building including, without limitation, brokerage commissions, costs of improving or constructing the Premises, rental abatement, architectural fees, engineering fees and legal fees (collectively the \u201cLease-Up Costs\u201d).\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, Landlord reserves full power, at any time after any such default, to do one or more of the following in Landlord\u2019s sole discretion: (i) immediately terminate the Lease by delivery of five (5) days prior written notice to Tenant in which event, Landlord may, at Landlord\u2019s option based on Landlord\u2019s reasonable estimate, accelerate and immediately make payable to Landlord all Rent and Additional Rent which would have due and payable if Tenant had continued the Lease Term and completed Tenant\u2019s obligations there under through the Lease Expiration Date; (ii) re-let said Premises for the account of Tenant for such term or terms (which may be greater or less than the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term) and on such conditions and upon such other terms (which may include Re-letting Costs as previously described) as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may determine; and/or (iii) cure the default at the expense of Tenant, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any reasonable amount expended by Landlord in connection with said cure, plus interest thereon from the date such cost is incurred by Landlord. All damages and related expenses, at the option of Landlord, may be recovered by Landlord at the time of the retaking and reentry, or in separate action(s), from time to time, as Tenant\u2019s obligation to pay Rent and Additional Rent would have accrued if the term had continued, or from time to time, as said damages and related expenses shall have been made more easily ascertainable by re-lettings of the Premises. In addition, such action by Landlord may, at the sole option of Landlord, be deferred until the expiration of the Lease Term, and no cause of action by Landlord hereunder shall be deemed to have accrued until the date of the termination of said term. Landlord shall also have the right to enjoin any breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the covenants, agreements, terms or conditions in this Lease. The foregoing remedies of Landlord shall be cumulative, and in addition to any remedies available under applicable law.\n\n# 18.02 Application of Proceeds\n\nAll Rents and payments received by Landlord from other tenants or users in any re-letting after Tenant\u2019s default shall be applied, first to the payment of such expenses as Landlord may have incurred in recovering possession of the Premises; second, to the repayment of the Re-letting Costs outlined above; third, to the repayment of any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord, either for making the necessary repairs to the Premises or in curing any default on the part of Tenant in any covenant or condition herein made binding upon Tenant; fourth, to the repayment of all Lease-Up Costs outlined above and last, any remaining Rent or payments shall be applied toward the payment of Rent and Additional Rent due from Tenant under the terms of this Lease (including all late fees, penalties and other charges outlined in the Lease), with interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum (or if lower the highest legal rate), and Tenant expressly agrees to pay any deficiency then remaining. Landlord shall in no event be liable in any way whatsoever (nor shall Tenant be entitled to any setoff) for Landlord's failure to re-let the Premises. In the event Landlord re-lets the Premises, any part thereof, together with other premises, or for a term extending beyond the scheduled expiration of the term hereunder, it is understood that Tenant will not be entitled to apply any Rent, Additional Rent or other sums generated or projected to be generated by any such other premises or in the period extending beyond the scheduled expiration of the term of this Lease against Landlord\u2019s damages.\n\nLandlord,\n\nTenant: Sunnybrook Investments, LLC\n\n6849 Old Dominion Drive Lease Agreement\n\n18",
