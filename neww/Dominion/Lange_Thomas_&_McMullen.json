Any such holdover shall be deemed to be a tenancy-at-sufferance and not a tenancy-at-will or tenancy from month-to-month. In no event shall any holdover be deemed a permitted extension or renewal of the Term, and nothing contained herein shall be construed to constitute Landlord's consent to any holdover or to give Tenant any right with respect thereto.\n\n# 22. SUBORDINATION\n\n# A. Lease Subordinate\n\nThis Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any and all Mortgages and to any Ground Leases, and any and all renewals, extensions, modifications, recastings and refinancings thereof. This clause shall be self-operative, without execution of any further instrument; but if requested by Landlord or any Mortgagee, Tenant shall promptly execute.",

PARKING.\n\n## A. Use of Parking.\n\n(1) During the Term, Tenant shall have the right to use (on a non-exclusive first-come, first-served basis) the Parking Permits (as defined in Section 1.Q hereinabove) for the unreserved parking of passenger automobiles in the parking areas designated from time to time by Landlord for the use of tenants of the Building (the \"Parking Area\"). Tenant understands and acknowledges that the Parking Area may be operated by or leased to a third party (Parking Operator) pursuant to an agreement with Landlord. As a result, the parties acknowledge that Tenant's parking rights shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Landlord\u2019s agreement with the Parking Operator. In the event that Tenant uses less than the number of Parking Permits set forth above, at any time, Tenant's right to use such spaces shall thereafter be decreased to the number of spaces Tenant is actually using; provided, however, that, throughout the Term, if at any time Tenant has not purchased all of the Parking Permits, Tenant shall have the right to obtain as many of such Parking Permits as Tenant has not then purchased upon sixty (60) days\u2019 prior written notice to Landlord. Landlord reserves the right to modify in any way Landlord deems appropriate the manner in which the Parking Area is accessed during the Term. Tenant shall not use the Parking Area for the overnight storage of vehicles. It is understood and agreed that Landlord assumes no responsibility, and shall not be held liable for any damage or loss to any automobiles parked in the Parking Area or to any personal property located therein or for any injury sustained by any person in or about the Parking Area.\n\n(2) Subject to the limitations imposed thereon from time to time by Landlord and/or the Parking Operator, Tenant's customers and visitors shall have the right to use available spaces in the Parking Area for the purpose of parking their vehicles therein while visiting the Premises. Tenant's customers and visitors shall pay the then current hourly parking fees established by Landlord and/or the Parking Operator, as adjusted from time to time, for the privilege of using the Parking Area. The foregoing shall in no way be construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation to provide customer parking for Tenant.\n\n(3) Landlord\u2019s granting of parking rights hereunder does not create a bailment between the parties, it being expressly agreed that the only relationship created between Landlord and Tenant hereby is that of right grantor and right grantee. All motor vehicles (including all contents thereof) shall be in the Parking Area at the sole risk of their owners and Tenant, and Landlord is not responsible for the protection and security of such vehicles. Neither Landlord nor any agent, employee or contractor of Landlord shall have any liability for any property damage or personal injury arising out of or in connection with said motor vehicles.",

Use of Parking.\n\n(1) During the Term, Tenant shall have the right to use (on a non-exclusive first-come, first-served basis) the Parking Permits (as defined in Section 1.Q hereinabove) for the unreserved parking of passenger automobiles in the parking areas designated from time to time by Landlord for the use of tenants of the Building (the \"Parking Area\"). Tenant understands and acknowledges that the Parking Area may be operated by or leased to a third party (Parking Operator) pursuant to an agreement with Landlord. As a result, the parties acknowledge that Tenant's parking rights shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Landlord\u2019s agreement with the Parking Operator. In the event that Tenant uses less than the number of Parking Permits set forth above, at any time, Tenant's right to use such spaces shall thereafter be decreased to the number of spaces Tenant is actually using; provided, however, that, throughout the Term, if at any time Tenant has not purchased all of the Parking Permits, Tenant shall have the right to obtain as many of such Parking Permits as Tenant has not then purchased upon sixty (60) days\u2019 prior written notice to Landlord. Landlord reserves the right to modify in any way Landlord deems appropriate the manner in which the Parking Area is accessed during the Term. Tenant shall not use the Parking Area for the overnight storage of vehicles. It is understood and agreed that Landlord assumes no responsibility, and shall not be held liable for any damage or loss to any automobiles parked in the Parking Area or to any personal property located therein or for any injury sustained by any person in or about the Parking Area.\n\n(2) Subject to the limitations imposed thereon from time to time by Landlord and/or the Parking Operator, Tenant's customers and visitors shall have the right to use available spaces in the Parking Area for the purpose of parking their vehicles therein while visiting the Premises. Tenant's customers and visitors shall pay the then current hourly parking fees established by Landlord and/or the Parking Operator, as adjusted from time to time, for the privilege of using the Parking Area. The foregoing shall in no way be construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation to provide customer parking for Tenant.\n\n(3) Landlord\u2019s granting of parking rights hereunder does not create a bailment between the parties, it being expressly agreed that the only relationship created between Landlord and Tenant hereby is that of right grantor and right grantee. All motor vehicles (including all contents thereof) shall be in the Parking Area at the sole risk of their owners and Tenant, and Landlord is not responsible for the protection and security of such vehicles. Neither Landlord nor any agent, employee or contractor of Landlord shall have any liability for any property damage or personal injury arising out of or in connection with said motor vehicles.",

Any violation of said applicable Rules and Regulations or failure by Tenant to pay parking fees will constitute a Default hereunder. Upon any such Default, in addition to Landlord's other rights and remedies, Landlord may terminate Tenant's rights to lease parking spaces in the Parking Area in accordance with the terms of Section 34.A.(1) above.\n\n(5) If (i) all or a portion of the Parking Area is damaged by fire or other casualty or taken by power of eminent domain or purchased in lieu thereof by any governmental authority, (ii) the insurance proceeds payable as a result of a casualty to the Parking Area are applied to a Mortgage, or (iii) there is any material uninsured loss to the Parking Area, Landlord may terminate Tenant's right to lease spaces in the Parking Area.

No Transfers. Tenant shall not assign, sublet or transfer any Parking Permits without Landlord\u2019s prior written consent, except to Tenant subtenants or assignees permitted under Section 23 or consented to by Landlord. Any attempted assignment, sublet, or transfer shall be void.

After the end of the second (2nd) Lease Year, the required amount of the Security Deposit at that time shall remain as the Security Deposit for the remainder of the Term hereof. Said Security Deposit shall be repaid to Tenant after the termination of this Lease (or any renewal thereof), provided Tenant shall have made all such payments and performed all such obligations hereunder.

If any such item that has not been approved by Landlord is so displayed, then Landlord shall have the right to remove such item at Tenant's expense or to require Tenant to do the same. Landlord reserves the right to install and display signs, advertisements and notices on any part of the exterior or interior of the Building.\n\n# 40. OPTION TO EXTEND\n\nProvided that Lange, Thomas & McMullen LLP, a District of Columbia limited liability partnership (\u201cLT&M'\u2019) is not then in default and has not been in default more than once during the Term, in each case both at the time of exercise of the Renewal Option, as hereinafter defined, and at the commencement of the Renewal Period, as hereinafter defined, and is then in occupancy of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Premises at the time of exercise of the Renewal Option, as hereinafter defined, and at the time of the commencement of the Renewal Period, as hereinafter defined, LT&M shall have one (1) option (the \"Renewal Option\") to extend the Term of the Lease for one (1) additional three (3) year period (the \"Renewal Period\") after the expiration of the initial Term. The Renewal Option shall be exercisable only by written notice given by LT&M to Landlord not later than twelve (12) months, nor earlier than fifteen (15) months, prior to the expiration of the initial Term. In the event that LT&M does not timely exercise the Renewal Option, said Renewal Option shall be null and void and of no further force or effect, time being of the essence in the exercise of the Renewal Option and it being acknowledged and agreed by LT&M that Landlord shall be entitled to rely on any failure by LT&M to give written notice of its exercise of its Renewal Option by the date set forth herein for such exercise thereof.\n\nAll terms and conditions of this Lease shall be applicable during the Renewal Period except that the amount of Base Rent charged for the Renewal Period shall be the then \"Prevailing Market Rent\", which shall be the rent for renewal tenants leasing comparable office space in comparable Class B buildings in the downtown section of Mclean, Virginia, taking into account such market concessions, if any, as are then being offered to renewal tenants leasing comparable office space in comparable Class B buildings in the downtown section of McLean, Virginia; provided, however, that in no event shall the Prevailing Market Rent determined as aforesaid be deemed to be less than the Base Rent payable under this Lease during the Lease Year immediately preceding the first Lease Year of the Renewal Period. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of LT&M's notice, Landlord and LT&M have not mutually agreed on the Prevailing Market Rent for the Renewal Period in question, then within ten (10) days after the expiration of such thirty-day period, each party shall give written notice to the other setting forth the name and address of a Broker (as hereinafter defined) selected by such party who has agreed to act in such capacity, to determine the Prevailing Market Rent. If either party shall fail to select a Broker as aforesaid, the Prevailing Market Rent shall be determined by the Broker selected by the other party. Each Broker shall thereupon independently make his determination of the Prevailing Market Rent within twenty (20) days after the appointment of the second Broker. If the two Brokers\u2019 determinations are not the same, but the higher of such two values is not more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the lower of them, then the Prevailing Market Rent shall be deemed",

If Tenant reasonably disapproves of the Proposed Plans as being inconsistent with the Space Plans, specifying in reasonable detail its reasons therefor, Landlord shall cause Architect to revise the Proposed Plans as disapproved by Tenant and resubmit the revised Proposed Plans to Tenant. Tenant shall, within three (3) business days after receipt of Architect\u2019s revised Proposed Plans, advise Landlord of any additional reasonable changes which Tenant requests in order to conform the Proposed Plans to the Space Plans. If Tenant disapproves the revised Proposed Plans specifying the reason therefor, Landlord shall, to the extent such proposed changes are reasonable, within ten (10) business days of receipt of Tenant\u2019s required changes, cause Architect to revise the Proposed Plans and resubmit them to Tenant. Tenant shall, again within three (3) business days after receipt of Architect\u2019s revised Proposed Plans, advise Landlord of further changes, if any, required for Tenant\u2019s approval. This process shall continue until Tenant has approved the revised Proposed Plans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall Landlord be required to cause more than two (2) revisions to the Proposed Plans. \u201cFinal Plans\u201d shall mean the Proposed Plans, as revised, which have been approved by Landlord and Tenant in writing. Tenant agrees not to withhold or deny its approval unreasonably.\n\n# D.\n\nLandlord shall not be required to perform, and Tenant shall not request, work which would (i) require changes to structural components of the Building or the exterior design of the Building, (ii) require any material modification to the Building systems or other Building installations.",
