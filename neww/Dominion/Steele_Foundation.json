      "final_text": "Tenant acknowledges that the foregoing is not intended to be an exclusive list of the reasons for which Landlord may reasonably withhold its consent to a proposed sublease. Neither the consent by Landlord to any assignment, transfer, or subletting to any party other than Landlord, nor an assignment, transfer or sublease permitted hereunder shall be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant from the terms of any covenant or obligation under this Lease, or of any guarantor under any guaranty of Lease provided to Landlord, nor shall the collection or acceptance of Rent from any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant constitute a waiver of, or release of, Tenant from any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease. In the event that Tenant defaults hereunder beyond all applicable cure periods, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord the Rent due from any subtenant of Tenant and hereby authorizes each such subtenant to pay said Rent directly to Landlord.\n\n## 11.02 Prohibited Transfers\n\nThe transfer of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant or subtenant of the Lease, or a majority of the total interest in any partnership Tenant or subtenant, however accomplished, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions, will be deemed an assignment of this Lease or of such sublease requiring Landlord\u2019s consent in each instance. In addition, if Tenant is a partnership, any dissolution of Tenant or withdrawal or change, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, of partners owning a controlling interest in Tenant shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provisions of this Section. For purposes of this Section, the transfer of outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant will not include any sale of such stock by persons other than those deemed \u201cinsiders\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, effected through the \u201cover-the-counter market\u201d or through any recognized stock exchange.\n\n## 11.03 Excess Rentals or other Sums\n\nIf any sublease or assignment (whether by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation an assignment pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or any other Insolvency Law) provides that the subtenant or assignee thereunder is to pay any amount in excess of the sum of (a) the rental and other charges due under this Lease plus (b) the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (excluding any costs attributable to vacancy periods or \u201cdowntime\u201d) which Tenant reasonably incurred in connection with the procurement or enforcement of such sublease, assignment or other transfer, then whether such excess be in the form of an increased monthly or annual rental, a lump sum payment, payment for the sale, transfer or lease of Tenant\u2019s fixtures, or leasehold improvements, or any other form (and if the subleased or assigned space does not constitute the entire Premises, the existence of such excess shall be determined on a pro-rata basis), Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent of any such excess of other premium applicable to the sublease or assignment, which amount shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as additional rent not later than thirty (30) days after any receipt thereof by Tenant. Acceptance by Landlord of any payments due under this Section shall not be deemed to constitute approval by Landlord of any sublease or assignment, nor shall such acceptance waive any rights of Landlord hereunder. Landlord shall have the right to inspect and audit Tenant\u2019s books and records relating to any sublease or assignment and expenses incurred by Tenant in connection therewith.\n\n## 11.04 Process to Request Landlord\u2019s Consent\n\nIf Tenant wishes to assign the Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises, Tenant shall, by notice in writing, advise Landlord of its intention from, on and after a stated date (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of Tenant\u2019s notice) to sublet more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises for the balance or any part of the Term or assign the Lease, and, in such event, Landlord shall have the right, to be exercised by giving written notice to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Tenant\u2019s notice, to recapture the space described in Tenant\u2019s notice and such recapture notice shall, if given, cancel and terminate this Lease with respect to the space therein described as of the date stated in Tenant\u2019s notice. Tenant\u2019s notice shall state the name and address of the proposed subtenant or assignee, shall include financial statements for the proposed subtenant or assignee reasonably requested by Landlord, and a true and complete copy of the proposed sublease or assignment shall be delivered to Landlord with said notice.

    "text": "Tenant acknowledges that the foregoing is not intended to be an exclusive list of the reasons for which Landlord may reasonably withhold its consent to a proposed sublease. Neither the consent by Landlord to any assignment, transfer, or subletting to any party other than Landlord, nor an assignment, transfer or sublease permitted hereunder shall be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant from the terms of any covenant or obligation under this Lease, or of any guarantor under any guaranty of Lease provided to Landlord, nor shall the collection or acceptance of Rent from any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant constitute a waiver of, or release of, Tenant from any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease. In the event that Tenant defaults hereunder beyond all applicable cure periods, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord the Rent due from any subtenant of Tenant and hereby authorizes each such subtenant to pay said Rent directly to Landlord.\n\n# 11.02 Prohibited Transfers\n\nThe transfer of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant or subtenant of the Lease, or a majority of the total interest in any partnership Tenant or subtenant, however accomplished, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions, will be deemed an assignment of this Lease or of such sublease requiring Landlord\u2019s consent in each instance. In addition, if Tenant is a partnership, any dissolution of Tenant or withdrawal or change, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, of partners owning a controlling interest in Tenant shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provisions of this Section. For purposes of this Section, the transfer of outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant will not include any sale of such stock by persons other than those deemed \u201cinsiders\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, effected through the \u201cover-the-counter market\u201d or through any recognized stock exchange.\n\n# 11.03 Excess Rentals or other Sums\n\nIf any sublease or assignment (whether by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation an assignment pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or any other Insolvency Law) provides that the subtenant or assignee thereunder is to pay any amount in excess of the sum of (a) the rental and other charges due under this Lease plus (b) the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (excluding any costs attributable to vacancy periods or \u201cdowntime\u201d) which Tenant reasonably incurred in connection with the procurement or enforcement of such sublease, assignment or other transfer, then whether such excess be in the form of an increased monthly or annual rental, a lump sum payment, payment for the sale, transfer or lease of Tenant\u2019s fixtures, or leasehold improvements, or any other form (and if the subleased or assigned space does not constitute the entire Premises, the existence of such excess shall be determined on a pro-rata basis), Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent of any such excess of other premium applicable to the sublease or assignment, which amount shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as additional rent not later than thirty (30) days after any receipt thereof by Tenant. Acceptance by Landlord of any payments due under this Section shall not be deemed to constitute approval by Landlord of any sublease or assignment, nor shall such acceptance waive any rights of Landlord hereunder. Landlord shall have the right to inspect and audit Tenant\u2019s books and records relating to any sublease or assignment and expenses incurred by Tenant in connection therewith.\n\n# 11.04 Process to Request Landlord\u2019s Consent\n\nIf Tenant wishes to assign the Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises, Tenant shall, by notice in writing, advise Landlord of its intention from, on and after a stated date (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of Tenant\u2019s notice) to sublet more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises for the balance or any part of the Term or assign the Lease, and, in such event, Landlord shall have the right, to be exercised by giving written notice to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Tenant\u2019s notice, to recapture the space described in Tenant\u2019s notice and such recapture notice shall, if given, cancel and terminate this Lease with respect to the space therein described as of the date stated in Tenant\u2019s notice. Tenant\u2019s notice shall state the name and address of the proposed subtenant or assignee, shall include financial statements for the proposed subtenant or assignee reasonably requested by Landlord, and a true and complete copy of the proposed sublease or assignment shall be delivered to Landlord with said notice. Tenant shall, concurrently with any request for Landlord\u2019s consent.\n\nTenant: Steele Foundation, LLC\n\n6849 Old Dominion Drive Lease Agreement",
