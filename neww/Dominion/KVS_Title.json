If any such alterations or additions are made by Tenant without Landlord\u2019s consent, Landlord may correct or remove them and Tenant shall be liable for any and all expenses incurred by Landlord in the performance of such work plus an administrative and coordination fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of such corrective or removal work. All plans and specifications for any such work shall be prepared by Tenant at Tenant\u2019s expense and shall thereafter be submitted to Landlord for its prior review and written approval. All alterations and additions to the Premises shall be performed by Landlord, or Landlord\u2019s contractors, at Tenant\u2019s expense, unless Landlord shall otherwise agree in writing. If any alterations or additions are made to the Premises on behalf of Tenant prior to or during Tenant\u2019s occupancy in the Building, including with respect to the initial Tenant improvements referenced on the Work Agreement, Tenant shall nevertheless pay to Landlord a Construction Coordination Fee equal to one (1%) percent of the hard costs of the work to be performed, with the entire amount (based on estimates if applicable) of said fee due prior to the beginning of the work, subject to reconciliation once the work is completed. This fee is to compensate Landlord for coordinating access to the Building, use of the Building\u2019s systems, Landlord\u2019s review of all plans and specifications and for access to the electrical, mechanical and telephone closets, as necessary. As a condition of Landlord\u2019s consent to the use of Tenant\u2019s contractor, Tenant or Tenant\u2019s contractor must obtain and provide evidence of insurance coverage to include: (a) Worker\u2019s Compensation Coverage and (b) Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance in the amount of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) in the aggregate. All work with respect to such alterations and additions shall be done in a good, workmanlike manner and diligently prosecuted to completion to the end that the Premises shall at all times be a complete unit except during the shortest period necessarily required for such work. All alterations or additions shall, upon completion, become Landlord\u2019s property and a part of the realty surrendered to Landlord upon the expiration of this Lease, unless Landlord shall, at the time of its approval of such work (or at the expiration of the lease per Section 14), require removal or restoration on the part of Tenant as a condition of such approval.

Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable notice and cure periods under this Lease;\n2. Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the proposed commencement of the assignment;\n3. with respect to a purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization or any Permitted Transfer which results in Tenant ceasing to exist as a separate legal entity,\n   1.

If requested by Landlord, Tenant\u2019s successor shall sign a commercially reasonable form of assumption agreement, which assumption agreement shall not obligate such successor to assume any additional obligations as the Tenant hereunder beyond those provided for in this Lease. As used herein, (A) \u201cparent\u201d shall mean a company which owns a majority of Tenant\u2019s voting equity; (B) \u201csubsidiary\u201d shall mean an entity wholly owned by Tenant or at least fifty-one percent (51.0%) of whose voting equity is owned by Tenant; and (C) \u201caffiliate\u201d shall mean an entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant or Tenant\u2019s parent.

Right of Access\n\n13.01 Landlord may, at reasonable times (and at any time in the event of an emergency as determined by Landlord) during the Lease Term enter to view or inspect the Premises; to determine whether Tenant is complying with its obligations under this Lease; to show the Premises to others; to make repairs to the Building or Premises; to replace, repair, alter or make new or change any fixtures, pipes, wires, ducts, conduits or other construction therein; or to remove placards, signs, lettering, window or door coverings and the like not expressly consented to. Landlord shall maintain a master key for entry at all times during the Term and Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord and provide Landlord with a new master key at Tenant\u2019s cost and expense if Tenant shall at any time change the locks on the suite entry doors. Tenant waives any claim against Landlord, its agents, employees, or contractors for damages for any injury or inconvenience to or interference with Tenant\u2019s business, any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Premises, or any other loss occasioned by any entry in accordance with this Section. Landlord may enter to place and maintain notices for letting, free from hindrance or control of Tenant, or to show the Premises to prospective tenants thereof at times which will not unreasonably interfere with Tenant\u2019s business. If Tenant shall vacate or abandon the Premises during the term of this Lease, Landlord shall have the unrestricted right to enter the same after Tenant\u2019s moving to make preparations for the succeeding tenant or for any other purpose whatever, without affecting Tenant\u2019s obligation to pay Rent for the full term.\n\n## Section 14.

Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable notice and cure periods under this Lease;\n2. Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the proposed commencement of the assignment;\n3. with respect to a purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization or any Permitted Transfer which results in Tenant ceasing to exist as a separate legal entity,\n1.

If requested by Landlord, Tenant\u2019s successor shall sign a commercially reasonable form of assumption agreement, which assumption agreement shall not obligate such successor to assume any additional obligations as the Tenant hereunder beyond those provided for in this Lease. As used herein, (A) \u201cparent\u201d shall mean a company which owns a majority of Tenant\u2019s voting equity; (B) \u201csubsidiary\u201d shall mean an entity wholly owned by Tenant or at least fifty-one percent (51.0%) of whose voting equity is owned by Tenant; and (C) \u201caffiliate\u201d shall mean an entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant or Tenant\u2019s parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any parent, affiliate or subsidiary to which this Lease has been assigned or transferred subsequently sells or transfers its voting equity or its interest under this Lease other than to another parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the original Tenant named hereunder, such sale or transfer shall be deemed to be a Transfer requiring the consent of Landlord hereunder.\n\n# Section 13.
