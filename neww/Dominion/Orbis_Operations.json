If Landlord elects to reenter pursuant to Section 19 above, Landlord may terminate this Lease, or, from time to time without terminating this Lease, may relet all or any part of the Premises as the agent of Tenant, for such term, at such rental and upon such other provisions as Landlord deems acceptable, with the right to make any alterations and repairs to the Premises that Landlord deems appropriate, at Tenant's expense. No such reentry or taking of possession of the Premises shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease, unless notice of such intention is given pursuant to Subsection B.(2) above, or unless termination be decreed by a court of law.",

Amount and Uses:\n\nLandlord acknowledges receipt from Tenant of the Security Deposit, to be held by Landlord as security for the payment of all Rent payable by Tenant and for the faithful performance by Tenant of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Said Security Deposit shall be repaid to Tenant after the termination of this Lease (or any renewal thereof), provided Tenant shall have made all such payments and performed all such obligations hereunder. Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Security Deposit in a separate account. The Security Deposit shall not be mortgaged, assigned, transferred or encumbered by Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord, and any such act shall be void. Landlord may, at Landlord's option, appropriate and apply the entire Security Deposit, or so much thereof as Landlord believes may be necessary, to compensate Landlord for the payment of any past-due Rent and for loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to any Default. In the event Landlord appropriates or applies the Security Deposit in such a manner, Tenant, within ten (10) days after notice thereof, shall pay to Landlord an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited. Tenant's failure to restore any such deficiency shall constitute a Default hereunder. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings by or against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be applied first to the payment of Rent due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.\n\n## B. Transferability:\n\nIn the event of a sale or transfer of Landlord's interest in the Building or of the interest of any successor or assign of Landlord, Landlord (or such successor or assign) shall have the right to transfer the Security Deposit to any vendee or transferee and shall thereupon be released automatically from any liability therefor. Tenant shall look solely to the transferee for the return of the Security Deposit. No Mortgagee or purchaser of any or all of the Building at any foreclosure proceeding shall (regardless of whether the Lease is at the time subordinated to the lien of said Mortgage) be liable to Tenant or any other person for any of the Security Deposit, or any other payment made by Tenant hereunder, unless Landlord has actually delivered said deposit or other such sum to such Mortgagee or purchaser.

    "text": "# 35. SECURITY DEPOSIT.\n\n# A. Amount and Uses:\n\nLandlord acknowledges receipt from Tenant of the Security Deposit, to be held by Landlord as security for the payment of all Rent payable by Tenant and for the faithful performance by Tenant of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Said Security Deposit shall be repaid to Tenant after the termination of this Lease (or any renewal thereof), provided Tenant shall have made all such payments and performed all such obligations hereunder. Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Security Deposit in a separate account. The Security Deposit shall not be mortgaged, assigned, transferred or encumbered by Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord, and any such act shall be void. Landlord may, at Landlord's option, appropriate and apply the entire Security Deposit, or so much thereof as Landlord believes may be necessary, to compensate Landlord for the payment of any past-due Rent and for loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to any Default. In the event Landlord appropriates or applies the Security Deposit in such a manner, Tenant, within ten (10) days after notice thereof, shall pay to Landlord an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited. Tenant's failure to restore any such deficiency shall constitute a Default hereunder. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings by or against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be applied first to the payment of Rent due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.\n\n# B. Transferability:\n\nIn the event of a sale or transfer of Landlord's interest in the Building or of the interest of any successor or assign of Landlord, Landlord (or such successor or assign) shall have the right to transfer the Security Deposit to any vendee or transferee and shall thereupon be released automatically from any liability therefor. Tenant shall look solely to the transferee for the return of the Security Deposit. No Mortgagee or purchaser of any or all of the Building at any foreclosure proceeding shall (regardless of whether the Lease is at the time subordinated to the lien of said Mortgage) be liable to Tenant or any other person for any of the Security Deposit, or any other payment made by Tenant hereunder, unless Landlord has actually delivered said deposit or other such sum to such Mortgagee or purchaser. In the event of any rightful and permitted assignment of Tenant's interest in this Lease, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to be held by Landlord as a deposit made by the assignee, and Landlord shall have no liability to the assignor with respect to the return of the Security Deposit.\n\n# 36. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.\n\n# A. Definition.\n\nAs used in this Lease, the term \"Hazardous Material\" means any flammable items, explosives, radioactive materials, hazardous or toxic substances, material or waste or related materials, including any substances defined as or included in the definition of \u201chazardous substances\", \"hazardous wastes\", \u201cinfectious wastes\", \"hazardous materials\" or \"toxic substances\" now or subsequently regulated under any Laws, including, without limitation, oil, petroleum-based products, paints, solvents, lead, cyanide, DDT, printing inks, acids, pesticides, ammonia compounds and other chemical products, asbestos, PCBs and similar compounds, and including any different products and materials which are subsequently found to have adverse effects on the environment or the health and safety of persons.\n\n# B.
