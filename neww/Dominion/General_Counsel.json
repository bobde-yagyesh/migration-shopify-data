Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Mortgagee may at any time subordinate the lien of its Mortgage to the operation and effect of this Lease without Tenant's consent, by giving Tenant written notice of such subordination, in which event this Lease shall be deemed to be senior to such Mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgagee shall have the same rights as it would have had if this Lease had been executed, delivered and recorded before said Mortgage.\n\nB. Modifications to Lease: If any of Landlord's insurance carriers or any Mortgagee requests modifications to this Lease, then Tenant shall execute a written amendment incorporating such requested modifications within thirty (30) days after the same has been submitted to Tenant by Landlord, provided that such modifications do not materially adversely affect Tenant's use of the Premises as herein permitted or increase the rentals and other sums payable by Tenant hereunder.

HOLDING OVER.\n\nIf Tenant shall be in possession of the Premises after termination of this Lease (whether by normal expiration of the Term or otherwise), at Landlord\u2019s option: (i) Landlord may deem Tenant to be occupying the Premises as a tenant from month-to-month, at the sum of (a) during the first thirty (30) days of such holdover occupancy, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Monthly Base Rent in effect for the last full month of the Term, and (b) thereafter, two hundred percent (200%) of the Monthly Base Rent in effect for the last full month of the Term, and, in each case (that is, with respect to any holdover to which either of the immediately foregoing clauses (a) or (b) or any combination thereof, applies), plus the monthly installment of Additional Rent which is then payable pursuant to Section 5, of this Lease, and subject to all of the other provisions of this Lease, as applicable to a month-to-month tenancy, and (ii) Landlord may exercise any or all remedies for Default and at law and in equity, including but not limited to an action against Tenant for wrongfully holding over and an action for actual and consequential damages. Any such holdover shall be deemed to be a tenancy-at-sufferance and not a tenancy-at-will or tenancy from month-to-month. In no event shall any holdover be deemed a permitted extension or renewal of the Term, and nothing contained herein shall be construed to constitute Landlord's consent to any holdover or to give Tenant any right with respect thereto.\n\n# 22. SUBORDINATION.\n\nA. Lease Subordinate: This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any and all Mortgages and to any Ground Leases, and any and all renewals, extensions, modifications, recastings and refinancings thereof. This clause shall be self-operative, without execution of any further instrument: but if requested by Landlord or any Mortgagee, Tenant shall promptly execute a certificate or other document evidencing and providing for such subordination within ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of such certificate. Landlord shall have the right to execute said document on behalf of Tenant if Tenant fails to do so within five (5) days after receipt of the request. Tenant agrees that, if any Mortgage is foreclosed or Ground Lease terminated, upon request by the purchaser at the foreclosure sale or Ground Lessor, as the case may be, Tenant shall attorn to and recognize the purchaser or Ground Lessor as the landlord under this Lease and shall make all payments required hereunder to such new landlord without any deduction or set-off of any kind whatsoever. Tenant waives the provisions of any Laws, now or hereafter in effect, which may give or purport to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise affect this Lease or the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event that any such foreclosure, termination or other proceeding is filed, prosecuted or completed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Mortgagee may at any time subordinate the lien of its Mortgage to the operation and effect of this Lease without Tenant's consent, by giving Tenant written notice of such subordination, in which event this Lease shall be deemed to be senior to such Mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgagee shall have the same rights as it would have had if this Lease had been executed, delivered and recorded before said Mortgage.\n\nB. Modifications to Lease: If any of Landlord's insurance carriers or any Mortgagee requests modifications to this Lease, then Tenant shall execute a written amendment incorporating such requested modifications within thirty (30) days after the same has been submitted to Tenant by Landlord, provided that such modifications do not materially adversely affect Tenant's use of the Premises as herein permitted or increase the rentals and other sums payable by Tenant hereunder. In the event that Tenant refuses or fails to execute such amendment within ten (10) days after Landlord's delivery of same to Tenant, then Landlord shall",
