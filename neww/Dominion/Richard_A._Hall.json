The foregoing notwithstanding, if Tenant wishes only to sublease all or a portion of the Premises (rather than assign the Lease, the consent to which being in Landlord\u2019s sole discretion), Landlord agrees not to unreasonably withhold its consent. Landlord\u2019s consent shall not be considered unreasonably withheld if (1) the proposed sublessee\u2019s financial responsibility does not meet the same criteria Landlord uses to select Building tenants; (2) the proposed sublessee\u2019s business is not suitable for the Building considering the business of the other tenants and the Building\u2019s prestige or would result in a violation of an exclusive right granted to another tenant in the Building; (3) the proposed use is different than the Permitted Use; (4) the proposed sublessee is an occupant of the Building; (5) Tenant is in default beyond any cure period; or (6) any portion of the Building or Premises would become subject to additional or different laws as a consequence of the proposed sublease and/or the proposed sublessee\u2019s use and occupancy of the Premises.
