Any violation of said applicable Rules and Regulations or failure by Tenant to pay parking fees will constitute a default hereunder. Upon any such default that continues past applicable notice and cure periods, in addition to Landlord\u2019s other rights and remedies, Landlord may terminate Tenant's rights to lease parking spaces in the Parking Area in accordance with the terms of Section 34.A.(1) above.\n\n(4) If (i) all or a portion of the Parking Area is damaged by fire or other casualty or taken by power of eminent domain or purchased in lieu thereof by any governmental authority, (ii) the insurance proceeds payable as a result of a casualty to the Parking Area are applied to a Mortgage, or (iii) there is any material uninsured loss to the Parking Area, Landlord may terminate Tenant's right to lease spaces in the Parking Area in accordance with the terms of subsection (a) above. If Landlord does not so elect to terminate such rights of Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 34.A.(5), then Landlord will either (a) proceed to restore the Parking Area (and Landlord shall have no obligation to provide any alternative parking while such restoration is being performed), or (b) not restore the Parking Area, but provide Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, with alternate parking throughout the remainder of the Term (if such alternative parking is reasonably available under the circumstances).\n\n# B. No Transfers\n\nTenant shall not assign, sublet or transfer any Parking Permits without Landlord\u2019s prior written consent, except pursuant to an assignment or sublease approved by Landlord. Any attempted assignment, sublet, or transfer, except in connection with an assignment of the Lease or sublet of the Premises, shall be void.\n\n# 35. SECURITY DEPOSIT\n\n# A. Amount and Uses\n\nLandlord acknowledges receipt from Tenant of the Security Deposit, to be held by Landlord as security for the payment of all Rent payable by Tenant and for the faithful performance by Tenant of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Said Security Deposit shall be repaid to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the later to occur of (i) the termination of this Lease (or any renewal thereof), or (ii) the date on which Tenant has cured all defaults, if any, under this Lease. Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Security Deposit in a separate account. The Security Deposit shall not be mortgaged, assigned, transferred or encumbered by Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord, and any such act shall be void.\n\nLandlord may, at Landlord's option, appropriate and apply the entire Security Deposit, or so much thereof as Landlord believes may be necessary, to compensate Landlord for the payment of any past-due Rent and for loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to any Default. In the event Landlord appropriates or applies the Security Deposit in such a manner, Tenant, within ten (10) days after notice thereof, shall pay to Landlord an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited. Tenant's failure to restore any such deficiency shall constitute a Default hereunder. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings by or against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be applied first to the payment of Rent due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.",
