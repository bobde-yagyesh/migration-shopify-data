Apart from Tenant's obligation to send Landlord a Recapture Offer for an assignment or a sublease of the entire Premises, Tenant may request Landlord's consent to any assignment or sublease (including a sublease of a portion of the Premises for all or a portion of the Term) in a notice that shall state the name and address of the proposed subtenant or assignee, shall include financial statements for the proposed subtenant or assignee reasonably requested by Landlord, and a true and complete copy of the proposed sublease or assignment.
